      "\n",
      "implementations [47, 71], thus resulting in lower job satisfaction, lower job performance, and higher \n",
      "\n",
      "turnover [2, 66]. These difficulties lead to a majority of ESs failing, with failure rates reported to be as high \n",

      "job performance and job satisfaction. From a practitioner perspective, such a nuanced understanding will \n",
      "\n",
      "help in better creating optimal impact of ES implementations on job outcomes. For example, organizations \n",
      "\n",
      "often empower their workers to allow them ownership of a new ES. Our findings, however, suggest caution \n",
      "\n",
      "in light of the possibility that ES implementations could dramatically increase or decrease job scope. Both \n",
      "\n",
      "the increase as well as the decrease in job scope may result in a negative effect on job outcomes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, we challenge the root metaphor assumption of linearity, which is shared by researchers \n",
      "\n",
      "working on topics related to jobs and organizational change including technology-induced change, that the \n",
      "\n",

      "SUMMARY OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE LITERATURE \n",
      "\n",
      "Information Systems (IS) research often investigates complex organizational phenomena. Sarker \n",
      "\n",
      "et al. [27], for example, recently provided an example of a complex, multidimensional, and a messy \n",
      "\n",
      "phenomenon with which IS researchers have to contend. Such complexity often arises because different \n",
      "\n",
      "users may appropriate the same technology in different ways. Valacich et al. [32] and Valacich et al. [33], \n",
      "\n",
      "for example, note that people often have different preferences for technology features in different \n",
      "\n",
      "evaluation contexts. Because of such complexity, IS researchers tend to use cutting-edge tools to test \n",
      "\n",
      "hypotheses. Califf et al. [9], for example, recently examined technostress among healthcare workers using \n",
      "\n",
      "a mixed-methods design. In this appendix, we summarize prior IS research relevant to the current \n",
      "\n",
      "research.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Complementing our literature review section, this appendix presents an organization and \n",
      "\n",
      "associated summary of literature primarily on the methodology used in the organizational change, job \n",
      "\n",
      "characteristics, and the enterprise system (ES) implementation literature. We conducted extensive \n",
      "\n",
      "searches using Web of Science and Google Scholar. We focused primarily on leading journals in IS, such \n",
      "\n",
      "as Journal of Management Information Systems, because these journals not only represent leading \n",
      "\n",
      "journals of the field, but also present cutting-edge theoretical advances in our field. In order to find the \n",
      "\n",
      "relevant research, we searched for keywords, such as organizational change, enterprise systems and IT \n",
      "\n",
      "implementations, and selected research published in the last decade. To help underscore the \n",
      "\n",
      "appropriateness of our approach and the value of our approach, we organize and summarize the studies \n",
      "\n",
      "that we found in two ways. The first organization and associated summary presents how IS research has \n",

      "modeled change in organizations. In particular, we focus on change stemming from a new IT \n",
      "\n",
      "implementation, similar to the context of the current work. The second organization and associated \n",

      "and his colleagues (for examples, see [14] and [16]) have argued that each scientific method has its \n",
      "\n",
      "strengths and its weaknesses. Valacich and his colleagues further contend that, because all research \n",
      "\n",
      "methods are imperfect, it is not wise to claim any one method is better than the other and “no single \n",
      "\n",
      "method can provide a complete picture of the phenomena we study” ([16]; p. 214). In a similar vein, Sarker \n",

      "\n",
      "In calling for a quest for scientific advancement, Dennis and Valacich [15] encouraged IS \n",
      "\n",
      "researchers to re-examine prior theories using new context and analytical techniques. One way IS \n",
      "\n",
      "researchers have done so is by examining complex relationships in order to better understand \n",

      "\n",
      "portal IT, Bao et al. [3] used two different econometric models because the traditional models would not \n",
